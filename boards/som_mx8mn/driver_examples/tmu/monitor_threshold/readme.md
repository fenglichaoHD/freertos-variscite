Overview
========
The TMU example shows how to configure TMU register to monitor and report the temperature from
the temperature measurement site located on the chip.

TMU has access to temperature measurement site located on the chip. It can signal an alarm
if a programmed threshold is ever exceeded.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- VAR-SOM-MX8M-NANO SoM
- J-Link Debug Probe
- proper power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect proper power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW7 to power on the board
2.  Connect a proper cable between the host PC and the J18 header, (pins UART3 TX, RX and GND) on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you will see the temperature output from the terminal
everytime when the pre-set threshold is reached.
